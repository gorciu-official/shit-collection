    <p>You destroyed the Lunar module. You have no way to go back to Earth. There was no emergency, you could wait a while...</p>
    <p>NASA knows. They sent help, but they're not so helpful. They obligated you to pay for two freaking Apollo missions - the one you're on and also the one that sent you back to Earth. The court agreed with NASA.</p>
    <p>You have to pay the enormus fine. You have to be responsible in life.</p>
    <p>You only have one option: <a href="/universe/earth.html">Back to Earth</a></p>
