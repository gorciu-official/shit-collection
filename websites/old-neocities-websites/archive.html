    <h1>The Greatest Archive of All Time</h1>
    <p>Everything constantly changes. This quote from another website is perfect:</p>
    <p class="quote">much like the ever-changing seas that connect us, it is in a constant state of flux.</p>
    <p>I sometimes recreate pages, because I think they don't match my website. Or maybe because I think I could make this better. Not everything changes slowly. Somethimes, there has to be a complete redesign of some pages. I usually put a time travel link or in other place where you can easily find it if you are reading my pages. But they are often hard to find through exploration. If you really want to see my site archive, expand this.</p>
